[FAQ]

1) How to stop Jetty?

 stopJetty.bat

2) How to test login?

 Include securty/login part of webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml

3) How to check DB after failed unit tests?

If the unit-tests fail you can look into the embedded java database using this H2 web console:

Execute 
 java -jar <pathToMavenRepo>/com/h2database/h2/1.3.152/h2-1.3.152.jar

this open http://192.168.1.104:8082/login.jsp and then connect to the database using this jdbc-url

jdbc:h2:target/testdb

and username "sa" and empty password.

You must change the jdbc url in hibernate.properties before to jdbc:h2:target/testdb though.

4) How to configure another database for production?

 Put the following into server-classpath
 - JDBC driver
 - Adapated copy of src/test/resources/hibernate.properties

5) How to add new users and/or roles?

 See web.xml and src/test/resources/jetty-users.properties

6) Why is the first page call so slow?

 Maybe because of hibernate, appserver and h2 initialization

7) How to debug remotely?

 Start jetty and connect to debug port 5005.

Enjoy!
